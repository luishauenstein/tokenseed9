# Boilerplate / Template for Next.js using wagmi and ethers.js

This template lets you start with a clean [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project as well as a "Connect Wallet" button that opens a modal for choosing between MetaMask and WalletConnect for connecting to Web3. It uses the [wagmi hook library](https://wagmi-xyz.vercel.app/).
